You may use your workstation and printed resources to complete this test.


In order to answer the following questions, you must reverse parts of the ReTestLabs.exe file.  Although it is an EXE, it is meant to represent a DLL exporting several API calls (so you can ignore the main entry point).


It has four named exports involving an undefined structure we will refer to as a "Session", given the exported function names:
•	CreateSession
•	DestroySession
•	SessionRead
•	SessionWrite


In addition to these functions, there is one non-exported sub-function used by one of them.

The Session object contains an internal buffer that can be written to and read from.  It has a maximum size that it can hold but can be re-allocated as needed up to the maximum size.

Much like real-world RE situations, you will likely not have enough time to fully annotate these functions.  Instead, focus on doing only what you will need to do to answer the following questions.

Ignore any code not directly calling or called by the four export functions.

Also, read through all of the questions FIRST; some of them provide useful information about what the code really does.
